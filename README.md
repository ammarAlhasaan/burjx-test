# Crypto Assignment

This is a React-based crypto UI built with a custom mini design system.

## Key Features

- ✅ Built from scratch using my own **mini design system**.
- ✅ Integrated **Fuse.js** for fast and flexible coin name search.
- ✅ Simulated **real-time updates** by polling the API every 10–30 seconds. In production, this would ideally be replaced by a **WebSocket** connection.
- ✅ Used **Roboto** as the main font due to rendering issues with the original Figma font (**Lufga** is available in `assets/` if needed).

## Known Limitations / To-Do

- ⏳ Add chart type toggle for chart type 
- ⏳ Add animation and loading screen for better UX.
- ⏳ Optimize the CSS variables for theme consistency and performance.
- ⏳ Support the Light mode 

## Setup

To run the project:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Runs on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
